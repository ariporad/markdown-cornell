# Classification of Substances

* Why do identical substances have different properties?
    * They're different at the atomic level
* How do we classify matter?
    * Matter is classified into 3 types
* What is an Element?
    * Only one type of atom
    * Ex: Iron Nail
* What is a Compound?
    * 2+ elements, bonded
* What is the Rule of Definite Proportions?
    * "atoms bond together in fixed, whole number ratios"
        * Always the same elements bonded in the same way
        * Ex: All ammonia is always 3 Hydrogen + 1 Nitrogen
* What is a Mixture?
    * 2+ non-bonded types
    * Ex: Coke
* What is a Pure Substance?
    * A compound or element
* What is an atom?
    * The smallest unit of matter
    * Q: What about electrons?
* What is a molecule?
    * A group of bonded atoms, but distinct from other molecules.

Knowing the classification of the various reactants might enable us to better understand tor optimize the reaction. It also might enable us to find some backup reactants for the astronauts.
